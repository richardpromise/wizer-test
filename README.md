This is a dynamic React web application where users can interact with a dashboard, navigate through different sections (such as Comments and Users), and perform CRUD operations like adding and updating users. The app uses modern web technologies such as React, React Router, and Tailwind CSS for responsive UI design.

The app features a sidebar navigation menu, modal windows for form submissions, and dynamic page updates without full reloads. It also includes tests to ensure reliability.

Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React Router: For navigation between views.
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
Framer Motion: For adding animations to the sidebar and UI components.
Vitest: A testing framework for unit and integration tests.
React Query: For fetching and mutating data from the API.
TypeScript: Static type checking for better development experience.
